The Beale Ciphers

Playing around with the Beale Ciphers. The version of the Declaration of Indepenede is from Project Guttenburg. The original intent was to automatically toggle through everything written before about 1840 or so and run the other two (unsolveed) ciphers agaisnt them and run the results against an English dictionary to chack for actual words.

From Wikipedia ...

The Beale ciphers are a set of three ciphertexts, one of which allegedly states the location of a buried treasure of gold, silver and jewels estimated to be worth over US$43 million as of January 2018. Comprising three ciphertexts, the first (unsolved) text describes the location, the second (solved) ciphertext accounts the content of the treasure, and the third (unsolved) lists the names of the treasure's owners and their next of kin.
