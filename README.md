The Beale Ciphers

An attempt at the the Beale Ciphers. The version of the Declaration of Indepenede is from Project Guttenburg. The original intent was to automatically toggle through everything written between about 1860 or so and run the other two ciphers agaisnt them and run the results against an English dictionary to chack for actual words.
