The Beale Ciphers

Went down the rabbit hole one Sunday afternoon with the Beale Ciphers... The version of the Declaration of Independence is from Project Guttenburg. The original intent was to automatically loop through everything substantial written before about 1840 or so and run the other two (unsolved) ciphers against them and then run the results against an English dictionary to check for actual words.

From Wikipedia ...

"The Beale ciphers are a set of three ciphertexts, one of which allegedly states the location of a buried treasure of gold, silver and jewels estimated to be worth over US$43 million as of January 2018. Comprising three ciphertexts, the first (unsolved) text describes the location, the second (solved) ciphertext accounts the content of the treasure, and the third (unsolved) lists the names of the treasure's owners and their next of kin."

Anyways, the results from this repo are all three cyphers applied against the Declaration of Independence (DoI). The corrections needed to make the second cipher solve exactly are also taken from the Wikipedia article. These are also appled to the first and third ciphers. The first is obviously also from the DoI because of the many resultant non-random alphabetical sequences, the third is non-consequential.
